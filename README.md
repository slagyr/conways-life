# Life

A graphical implementaion of Conway's Game of Life.  The simulation logic is written in Clojure 
while the GUI is JAva/Swing code.
   
# Build & Run

Intellij's GUI builder was used for the GUI, so unfortunately the you need Intellij to build.
.idea project files included.

Once built, running is easy:

    lein run
    
# Test

    lein spec
    
# Development
